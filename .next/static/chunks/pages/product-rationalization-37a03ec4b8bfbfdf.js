The current state also increases costs and time-to-market, thereby inhibiting banks’ ability to innovate, respond to market changes and meet the changing customer expectations effectively. A rip-and-replace approach to address such challenges is not viable for business continuity reasons and especially since these old systems contain large amounts of valuable product and customer data. Besides, the stability of these systems is critical, and any considerable changes to the core are extremely high risk and time intensive. However, banks can no longer afford to stick to the old approach given the current market conditions, characterized by the increasingly demanding customer and a whole new set of technology-led competitors.

A seemingly large product portfolio suggesting a broad choice is self-defeating. Undifferentiated products only increase confusion for the customers, create difficulties for bank staff selling multiple, yet almost homogenous products and raise the cost of maintenance in terms of IT, people and processes.

This is possible because the platform acts as an engagement layer which effectively decouples the market-facing and core systems. A rationalized product portfolio can help banks to develop highly differentiated offerings based on context and without adding new products. The rule-based nature of the solution will allow the same base set of products to contain customized conditions such as bundles, pricing, benefits and rewards among other variants to meet the exact needs of customers in any given context. Simply put, banks can create as many personalized offers as needed without adding to product proliferation. In addition, the product and offer management capabilities will help banks manage the entire product and offer lifecycles, including ideation, simulation, launch, review and renewal, through a single, agile, enterprise-wide technology layer. Banks can also utilize our solution to incorporate partner products and services into the centralized engagement layer, broadening true customer
