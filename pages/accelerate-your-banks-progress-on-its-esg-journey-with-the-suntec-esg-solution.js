Measure employee wellbeing metrics (diversity & inclusion, leave policies, pay equity, employee safety, etc.), customer satisfaction metrics (customer satisfaction score, net promoter score, customer feedback and reviews, meeting compliance mandates, etc.), as well as measure how your customer’s business impacts their partners, the community, and society at large (factors that have an impact on society and monitoring business performance in the social area).</p>
            <p className='fs-5'>Social indicators are an integral part of ESG, and your bank can now push for positive change at corporates whose practices are lagging. Make it easier for your customers to contribute to charities and social causes. You can enable customers to pay out a percentage of their earnings (interest/cashback/dividends) to charitable causes while also providing tax benefits to them. Overtime, this can be offered even globally, so that donors can contribute to non-profit organizations that are driving social action in different countries.</p>
