        <p className="fs-5">Most U.S. banks have traditionally treated account analysis as the means to fulfill operational needs around pricing and billing. With the right mindset, approach, and solution, it can be so much more. By modernizing account analysis, you can use this as an especially valuable tool for customer acquisition/retention and service differentiation in a highly competitive business environment characterized by increasingly demanding customers, new players, high interest rates, and rapid digitalization.</p>
        <p className='fs-5'>Many U.S. banks have not harnessed the transformative potential of account analysis yet as shown in the findings of a survey <Link href="/reports/its-time-to-reinvent-account-analysis/">It’s Time to Reinvent Account Analysis</Link>, conducted by the American Banker on our behalf in January 2023.</p>
        <ul>
          <li className='fs-5'>80% indicated that error-free billing was essential, but was a significant challenge due to legacy systems.</li>
          <li className='fs-5'>85% of respondents indicated that adding real-time components to account analysis would benefit their customers.</li>
          <li className='fs-5'>Modernization of account analysis function lags other processes in more than a third of the banks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Enhance Customer Experience with Smarter, Faster Account Analysis</h2>
        <p className="fs-5">It is time corporate banks like yours take a long, hard, holistic look at the account analysis function to ensure that you are not leaving profitable growth opportunities on the table.</p>
        <p className='fs-5'>SunTec Account Analysis Solution gives you a whole lot more so you can compete better.</p>
        <p className="fs-5">With SunTec Account Analysis Solution your bank can forge stronger relationships with your customers. Implemented as an intelligent middle-layer, the solution is compatible with all legacy core banking systems and pulls customer data dispersed across systems. It can be deployed quickly and scaled easily, with minimal business disruption. This overcomes a major pain point that many banks experience because of the “technical debt.”</p>

                      adjust prices during the term of the contract based on defined triggers (e.g., end of promotion
                      period pricing or non-achievement of agreed targets). Such changes to pricing are instantaneous
                      (relative to the time needed to make manual changes for multiple customers),
                      thus minimizing the risk of the bank losing revenue.</p>

                        contract period. Often, though, customer account management teams are ill-prepared because
                        they do not have the necessary details (across all geographies, lines of business,
                        product/service etc.). Our solution equips your sales/relationship management teams
                        with the relevant data to help them negotiate more effectively. This reduces the risk
                        that special lower pricing remains the norm, in turn reducing the bank’s revenue and margins.
                        Our account analysis solution allows every individual customer relationship to be viewed and
                        managed holistically, and through a unified workflow, rather than through ad hoc, disjointed
                        processes. This approach also safeguards relationships from the exit of personnel.</p></>)}

                      Banks can attract corporate customers with hybrid accounts that benefit customers by reducing the

                      balances that customers will have the incentive to maintain. Our account analysis solution makes
                      it easy for your bank to manage such hybrid accounts, while simultaneously giving your customers
                      real-time information to manage balances, cash flows, and floats more efficiently.</p>
